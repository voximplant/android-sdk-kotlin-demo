# Voximplant Audio Call Demo with ConnectionService integration

This demo demonstrates audio call of the Voximplant Android SDK with ConnectionService integration. The application supports audio calls between this Android app and other apps that use any Voximplant SDK. 

Based on MVVM architectural pattern.

`ConnectionService` is an abstract service that could be implemented by any apps which either: 
1. Can make phone calls (VoIP or otherwise) and want those calls to be integrated into the built-in phone app. Referred to as a system managed `ConnectionService`.
2. Are a standalone calling app and don't want their calls to be integrated into the built-in phone app. Referred to as a self managed `ConnectionService`.
`ConnectionService` requires Android API level 23 according to the [official Android documentation](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/telecom/ConnectionService), but this app uses `Connection.PROPERTY_SELF_MANAGED` which requires API level 26.

## Features
The application is able to:
- log in to the Voximplant Cloud
- make an audio call
- receive an incoming call
- put a call on hold / take it off hold
- change an audio device (speaker, receiver, wired headset, bluetooth headset) during a call
- mute audio during a call
- receive push notifications (requires additional setup)
- proximity sensor usage
