# Voximplant Video Call Demo (Android)

This demo demonstrates basic video call and screen sharing functionality of the Voximplant Android SDK. 
The application supports video calls between this Android app and other apps that use any Voximplant SDK.
Based on MVVM architectural pattern.

## Features
The application is able to:
- log in to the Voximplant Cloud
- make an video call
- receive an incoming call
- put a call on hold / take it off hold
- change an audio device (speaker, receiver, wired headset, bluetooth headset) during a call
- mute audio during a call
- enable/disable sending video
- share screen
- change video camera
- receive push notifications (requires additional setup)
- turn off the touch screen during calls when your ear is close to the screen (proximity sensor usage)

#### Android 9
Because of the [limited access to sensors in background](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/pie/android-9.0-changes-all#bg-sensor-access) in Android 9,
we have made a foreground service to access microphone while app is in the background.

See the following file for code details:
- [CallService](src/main/java/com/voximplant/demos/kotlin/video_call/services/CallService.kt) (also used to work with proximity sensor)

#### Android 10
Because of the [restrictions on starting activities from the background](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/activities/background-starts) in Android 10,
we have made NotificationHelper class build and show full screen notifications

See the following file for code details:
- [NotificationHelper](src/main/java/com/voximplant/demos/kotlin/video_call/utils/NotificationHelper.kt)
